                        This demo shows how the very same type / implementation of ViewModel can be used by both UIKit UIViewController and SwiftUI.

                        The main advange of this approach is that you can be building modern View Models which will work well with SwiftUI in future.

                        If you cannot drop iOS 12 support yet to use only SwiftUI, you can still keep using UIViewControllers with modern View Model implementation. When migrating to SwiftUI in future, View Model can stay untouched and you only need migrate UIViewController to SwiftUI, which should be quite simple and straighforward.
